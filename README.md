## Overview

This is a monorepository is for my home kubernetes clusters.
I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like,  [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

The purpose here is to learn k8s, while practicing Gitops.

---

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

My Kubernetes cluster is deployed with [Talos](https://www.talos.dev). It is a low power hyper converged cluster which runs all my workloads. I have a separate NAS with ZFS for NFS/SMB shares, bulk file storage and backups.

There is a template over at [onedr0p/cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template) if you want to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Core Components

- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): self-hosted Github runners
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): creates SSL certificates for services in my cluster
- [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium): eBPF-based networking for my workloads.
- [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared): Enables Cloudflare secure access to my routes.
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): automatically syncs DNS records from my cluster ingresses to a DNS provider
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/): managed Kubernetes secrets using [1Password](https://1password.com/).
- [rook-ceph](https://rook.io/): Cloud native distributed block storage for Kubernetes
- [sops](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): managed secrets for Talos, which are committed to Git
- [spegel](https://github.com/XenitAB/spegel): stateless cluster local OCI registry mirror
- [envoy-gateway](https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway): Gateway API management for my HTTProutes.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync): backup and recovery of persistent volume claims

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches the clusters in my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my clusters based on the state of my Git repository.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the `kubernetes/${cluster}/apps` folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations (`ks.yaml`). Under the control of those Flux kustomizations there will be a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged Flux applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).


```sh
üìÅ kubernetes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ apps       # applications
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ components # re-useable kustomize components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ flux       # flux system configuration
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

The alternative solution to these two problems would be to host a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud and deploy applications like [HCVault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/), and [Gatus](https://gatus.io/). However, maintaining another cluster and monitoring another group of workloads is a lot more time and effort than I am willing to put in.

## üåê DNS

In my cluster there are two instances of [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) running. One for syncing private DNS records to my `RB5009` using [ExternalDNS webhook provider for Mikrotik](https://github.com/mirceanton/external-dns-provider-mikrotik), while another instance syncs public DNS to `Cloudflare`. This setup is managed by creating ingresses with two specific classes: `internal` for private DNS and `external` for public DNS. The `external-dns` instances then syncs the DNS records to their respective platforms accordingly.
